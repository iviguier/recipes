Ingredients:
- 1 pound large (16-20 count) raw shrimp, shelled and de-veined
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 2-3 Tbsp butter
- Salt
- 3-4 garlic cloves, slivered, or 1 Tbsp minced garlic
- 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (less or more to taste)
- 1/2 cup white wine
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley
- Freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 Tbsp lemon juice

Directions:
1. Heat a sauté pan on high heat then reduce to medium high heat. Swirl the
butter and olive oil into the pan. After the butter melts it will foam up a
bit then subside. If using unsalted butter, sprinkle a little salt in the
pan. Stir in the slivered garlic and red pepper flakes.
2. Sauté the garlic for just a minute, until it begins to brown at the edges,
then add the shrimp. Add the wine and stir to coat the shrimp with the sauce
of butter, oil, and wine. Move the shrimp so they are in an even layer in the
pan. Increase the heat to high and boil the wine for two to three minutes.
3. Stir the shrimp and arrange them so that you turn them over to cook on the
other side. Continue to cook on high heat for another minute.
4. Remove the pan from the heat. Sprinkle the shrimp with parsley, lemon
juice, and black pepper, and toss to combine.

Serve as is, or with crusty bread, over pasta, or over rice (for gluten-free
version).
